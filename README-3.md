# Crystal Structure Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict crystal structures using machine learning and data preprocessing techniques. The model takes inputs such as atomic number, cohesive energy, valence electrons, and period in the periodic table to make predictions.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - scikit-learn
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model**: Implements a predictive model to determine crystal structures.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing input data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilizes key chemical properties as features for the model.
- **Visualization**: Provides visualizations for data analysis and model performance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TilakSanghvi/Crystal_Structure_Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Crystal_Structure_Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Crystal_structure_Prediction_model.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data and train the prediction model.
